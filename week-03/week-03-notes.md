**Questions and comments:**

   * Nicky: If "open research" is the more inclusive wider term for "open science" what is the equivalent for "citizen science"?
       * I'm not sure but I have heard that moving away from "citizen" and towards "community" as a way to avoid impling that illegal immigrants/refugees/non-citizens are not included [https://debspark.audubon.org/news/why-were-changing-citizen-science-community-science](https://debspark.audubon.org/news/why-were-changing-citizen-science-community-science) particularly in the US context
       * Malvika: I'd say for open research allows us to include humatities and social sciences who may not directly relate to science as their area of work. I have definitely heard of the Citizen as exclusionary -- other suggestions are 'participatory' (Carmel mentioned this in the chat too)
       * Yo: All terms are flawed -- we should use what works for the audience with engage with while acknowlegding the limitation.
       * Claudia: in the huge field of science communciation we tend to use "public engagement" recently... so maybe open public engagement?? too cumbersome?? +1 -- public engagement and participatory research sound like good alternative +1 I haven't heard of participatory before but I like the implication
       * Paz: I prefer community science instead of citizen science (as it makes us think of citizen and also cities) +1 that's interesting -- I do use community-based research but did not consider them citizen science as I still work with researchers in doing those research
